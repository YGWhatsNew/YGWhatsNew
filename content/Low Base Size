From today, analysis using derived values (%, Index, Z-score) will appear gray instead of black if the sample falls below 100. Data-bars are included too, they will appear gray instead of the usual red, green or light blue when the sample falls below 100.  

The color change is to ensure you are aware of the low base size as this could impact any insights taken from the data.

The Low Base Size Warning, where derived values (%, Index, Z-score) appear in gray when the sample falls below 100, also extends into exports but only from the Analyze and Multi-tables modes (Profiles mode is not included).
