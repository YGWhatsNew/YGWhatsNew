We’re excited to share the latest update as part of ongoing improvements to YouGov Profiles – a new taxonomy for our variables. 

We listened to client needs, and we’ve restructured YouGov Profiles to make it easier to find what clients need more efficiently, quickly and intuitively. Our new taxonomy allows clients to easily navigate our vast (400,000+ and growing!) selection of variables clients need to access. Most importantly there will be no change to filters, custom variables, favorites, saved analyses, or Multitables — no changes are required from clients and this will have no impact on existing assets.


**When is this change taking place?** 

The new taxonomy went live on November 29th, 2020 in all global markets. 


**What is the new structure?**

Here is an overview of how the old taxonomy translates into the new structure so you can find the variables you’re looking for.

As always, you can use the search function to find any variables if you are unsure of their folder location. Click here to view the datamaps for each market.

If you have any questions relating to these changes, please do not hesitate to contact your YouGov Client Service Representative who will be happy to talk you through the new taxonomy.
