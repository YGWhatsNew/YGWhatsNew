From today, analysis using derived values (%, Index) in Profiles will appear grey instead of black if the sample falls below 100. Data-bars are included too, they will appear grey instead of the usual light blue when the sample falls below 100. 

The Z-score column will remain in color showing any statistically significant differences.

The color change is to ensure you are aware of any low base sizes which could impact any insights taken from the data.

The Low Base Size Warning, where derived values (%, Index) appear in grey when the sample falls below 100, also now extends into exports but only from the Analyze and Multi-tables views (the Profiles view is not included).   

Below is a partial screenshot illustrating what you will see when you are working in an Excel export.
