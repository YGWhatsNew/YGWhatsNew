YouGov Likes data was our original source of data for identifying people who like, or dislike, a wide range of categories. To provide an alternative data system using more robust collection methods for collecting affinity data across these categories, we launched our YouGov Ratings data in the US in November 2017, and in the UK in May 2018. After three years of data collection within YouGov Ratings, we’re now ready to make the switch, removing Likes from YouGov Profiles.


**When is this change taking effect?** 
- The last dataset with Likes data included in YouGov Profiles will be published on August 30th, 2020. 
- The first dataset without Likes will be published on September 6th, 2020.
- The Likes entities that have been used by any client over the past 12 months have been moved to YouGov Ratings, and will be published in this week’s (August 16th) dataset to ensure a smooth transition to start using the alternative source of affinity data.
- Historical Likes data will still exist in previous datasets.

**Why are we doing this and what are the benefits?**
Removing Likes from Profiles will:
- Allow datasets to be available earlier in the week
- Create more space for additional, new data in the YouGov Profiles
- Improve data processing capacity and help performance 
- Ensure that entities have robust sample sizes

If you have any queries relating to these changes, please do not hesitate to contact your YouGov Client Service Representative.
