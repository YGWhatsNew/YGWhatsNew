When new variables replace legacy variables, legacy variables will now be moved to a ‘Transitioning’ folder. 

From October onwards, when we need to replace a legacy variable with a new variable the legacy variable will be moved into a ‘Transitioning’ folder for a period of time, and eventually removed. If legacy variables were immediately removed as a new variable becomes live it would impact existing filters/assets that use the variable, and therefore a transitioning period has been introduced. The ‘Transitioning’ folder will only be visible in the Profiles dataset once it contains one or more legacy variables. 

**If existing Filters, Favourites or My Variables contain a legacy variable please ensure you replace that variable with the new variable. For some variables, it will take a little time for the coverage on the new variable to build up to the level of the legacy variable, and in these cases it is possible to continue to use the legacy variable while this happens.** 

To make the switch from legacy variables to new variables as easy as possible, all legacy variables are clearly labelled ‘Transitioning’ or ‘transitional’. See below. 


A summary of all legacy variables can be found within the ‘Transitioning’ folder in the main Profiles taxonomy (apart from Attitude variables in GB, USA and Germany). See below.


A summary of legacy Attitude variables in GB, USA and Germany can be found within the ‘Transitioning’ folder contained within the Attitudes section. See below.
